## Description

**FluorCam Toolbox** is a comprehensive R Shiny web application designed to streamline the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence data generated by **PSI FluorCam systems**. The application provides a user-friendly interface for processing multiple `.TXT` files simultaneously, performing automated statistical analyses, and generating publication-ready visualizations without requiring programming knowledge.

Key features include:
- **Automated data processing**: Handles FluorCam's native .TXT output format with flexible file naming patterns
- **Statistical analysis**: Automatic selection between parametric and non-parametric tests with post-hoc analyses
- **Time-course analysis**: Quantile Generalized Additive Models (qGAM) for robust temporal data modeling
- **Professional visualizations**: Publication-quality plots with statistical annotations
- **Multi-format export**: High-resolution graphics and statistical results in multiple formats
- **Session isolation**: Secure multi-user support with automatic cleanup

## Requirements

**R Version**: ≥ 4.0.0

**Key Dependencies**:
- shiny, shinydashboard (UI framework)
- ggplot2, ggpubr (visualizations)  
- mgcv (GAM modeling)
- multcomp, PMCMRplus (statistical testing)
- DT, readr (data handling)

All dependencies are automatically managed through the `global.R` configuration file in the application directory.

For a complete list of required packages, please refer to the `global.R` file.  
If you encounter issues with automatic package installation, you can manually install the required packages using the following R command for each package:

```R
install.packages("package_name", dependencies = TRUE)
library(package_name)
```

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Local Installation

For individual use on your personal computer:

1. **Install R and RStudio** (if not already installed)

2. **Download the zip file from the latest release**:  
   Extract the contents to a desired location on your computer. This will create a folder named `shiny_fluorcam`.
3. **Launch the application**:
   - Open RStudio
   - Go to `File` -> `Open File...`
   - Select the `App.R` in the `shiny_fluorcam` directory
   - Click the `Run App` button in the panel at the top left of the RStudio IDE.
 
   The application will open in your default web browser.

> Note: During the first launch, R will automatically install all required packages specified in the `global.R` file.
> Depending on your internet connection and system performance, this may take several minutes.  
> Subsequent launches will be significantly faster.  
> If you encounter any issues with package installation, please refer to the **Requirements** section below for manual installation instructions.  
> For further assistance, consult the **Support** section.

### Method 2: Server Installation (Ubuntu 24)

For multi-user deployment on a dedicated server:

#### Prerequisites Installation
```bash
sudo apt install -y gfortran cmake libfontconfig1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt install -y libxml2-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev
sudo apt install -y libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev
sudo apt install -y liblapack-dev libblas-dev libnlopt-dev
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends software-properties-common dirmngr
```

#### R Installation (Latest Version)
```bash
# Add CRAN repository key
wget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc

# Add CRAN repository
add-apt-repository "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)-cran40/"

# Install R and Shiny
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends r-base
sudo R -e "install.packages('shiny', repos='https://cran.rstudio.com/')"
```

#### Shiny Server Installation
```bash
sudo apt install -y gdebi-core
cd /tmp
SHINY_VERSION=x.x.x.x   # for instance: 1.5.23.1030
curl -O "https://download3.rstudio.org/ubuntu-20.04/x86_64/shiny-server-${SHINY_VERSION}-amd64.deb"
sudo gdebi shiny-server-${SHINY_VERSION}-amd64.deb
rm shiny-server-${SHINY_VERSION}-amd64.deb
```

#### Deploy the Application
1. **Upload application files** to `/srv/shiny-server/fluorcam_toolbox/` using SFTP with the `shiny` user account
2. **Access the application** via web browser at: `http://<server-address>:3838/fluorcam_toolbox/`

## files and directories

- Configuration file: `/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf`
- Application directories: `/srv/shiny-server/`
- Log directory: `/var/log/shiny-server/`

#### Server Management Commands
```bash
# Check server status
sudo systemctl status shiny-server

# Start/stop/restart server
sudo systemctl start shiny-server
sudo systemctl stop shiny-server
sudo systemctl restart shiny-server

# View logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/shiny-server/*.log
```

## Usage

Detailed step-by-step usage instructions are available in the **help.md** document, which can be accessed directly from the application interface through the help section. This comprehensive guide covers:

- File preparation and naming conventions
- Data loading procedures
- Statistical analysis options
- Visualization customization
- Export procedures
- Troubleshooting common issues

# Sample Data
Sample FluorCam `.TXT` files for testing and demonstration purposes can be found in the `sample_data/` directory within the application folder. Users are encouraged to utilize these files to familiarize themselves with the application's features and functionalities.  
> Currently, only PSI FluorCam `.TXT` files are supported.
